# Percolation

This package is for simulating percolation theory. You can computer cluster size and check if percolating or not.

Support for following lattice site percolation.

- Square lattice
 - nearest neighbor
 - next nearest neighbor
- Triangular lattice
 - nearest neighbor
- d dimensional simple lattice
 - nearest neighbor
- Honeycomb lattice
 - nearest neighbor
- Kagome lattice
 - nearest neighbor
